## Maintance
We have a few features that couldn't come to fruition due to time constraint and higher priorities. Some of them include changing the theme of the app, content label, multi-user functionality and sort recipes by rating. The remaining features are marked as "future features" under milestones for potential future development.

Insturction for marker when using our app for iteration_3 marking:
===================================================================

Dear marker:

Hi!

If you have marked our app previously and still have our app installed in your emulator, please uninstall the app and reinstall it before using and marking it.
Our new feature involves creating new table in the database and populating the database with new data, the changes in the script file will not be copied over
unless the app is uninstalled and reinstalled again. For the purpose of making the app works properly, please do so to get the best experience.

Sincerely,

Group 10
